# Set up project with webpack

In this exercise we will build a simple yet powerful webpack boilerplate, which we can later use as a starting point in our projects. We will be working with the webpack official guides.

### Instructions

**Initialize a new project and install webpack**
   - First set up a new GitHub repository for this exercise.
   - Follow the instructions from the getting started guide to set up the basics. Implement all the steps from Basic Setup to NPM Scripts.
- 
**Add HTML**

   - All the distribution files will be placed in /dist directory. You also know that you should not create files manually in the /dist folder, as there's a risk they will be overwritten. Therefore, install the HtmlWebpackPlugin to automatically create the index.html file in the /dist directory.
   - Follow the instructions from the setting up HtmlWebpackPlugin guide. Be extra careful when updating the module.exports object in your webpack.config.js file, to not to make any nesting mistakes.
   - Now delete all the files from the /dist directory and run:
  
    `npm run build`
